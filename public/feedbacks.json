They know everything about every bike the rent (huge selection of rental motorcycles) and about the bikes they sell as well. I like supporting local business and they are probably the best local motorcycle shop in orange county. Thanks guys, you're the best!"

At OC we had an extremely friendly service and the bikes we've been looking for were fortunately still available! I had the scrambler, my dad the 1200 Sportster and both were in a top condition! Thank you OC team again for the perfect service!!!"

Me and my husband traveled a total of 12,000miles with a R1100GS BMW and a Honda CBR1000RR all the way from Costa Mesa to Alaska and back to Costa Mesa. OC Motorcycles gave us quality service with decent prices. I highly recommend this place."

I'm always impressed with the customer service at OCM and this time I noted what great shape the bikes are in. No old beaters here! I really do enjoy renting from them. I can't wait for my next adventure."
